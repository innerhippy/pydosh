<h1>Import<br></h1>

<p>This section describes how to import statements into pydosh.</p>

<p> From the options menu at the top, click on Import and you'll be prompted
with a file dialog. Select the CSV format file or files you wish to
import and select the relevant account type from the bottom drop down.</p>

<p>pydosh will then read the file(s) and present what it's found to you.</p>

<p>Records that can be imported will be marked as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ready</span>. 
Records it doesn't understand and marked as <span style="font-style: italic;">Error</span>. 
Baks tend to add a lot of crap to their statements, so you'll probably see a few errors which can probably be just ignored.</p>

<p>You will never import a record twice, so don't worry if transactions overlap in statements or if
you've imported a statement twice. Transactions that exist &nbsp;will
be flagged as <span style="font-style: italic;">Imported</span>.</p>

<p>Only records that are marked with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ready</span> will be imported, so it's probably safe just 
to press the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Select All</span> button, followed by the 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Import</span> button.<br></p>
