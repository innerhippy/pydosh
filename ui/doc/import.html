<h1>Import<br></h1>
<p>This section describes how to import statements into doshlogger.</p><p> From
the options menu at the top, click on Import and you'll be prompted
with a file dialig. Select the CSV format file or files you wish to
import and select the relavant account type from the bottom drop down.</p>
<p>Doshlogger will then read the file(s) and present what it's found to you.</p>
<p><img style="width: 660px; height: 352px;" alt="" source=":doc/images/import.png"></p>
<p>Records that it can import will be marked as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ready</span>. Records that it's seen before are marked as <span style="font-style: italic;">Duplicate</span>. And ones which it doesn't understand and marked as <span style="font-style: italic;">Error</span>. Baks tend to add a lot of crap to their statements, so you'll probably see a few errors which can probably be just ignored.</p><p>You will never import a record
twice, so don't worry if transactions overlap in statements or if
you've imported a statement twice. Transactions that exist &nbsp;will
be flagged as <span style="font-style: italic;">Imported</span>.</p><p>Only records that are marked with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ready</span> will be imported, so it's probaly safe just to press the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Select All</span> button, followed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Import</span> button.<br></p></body></html>
