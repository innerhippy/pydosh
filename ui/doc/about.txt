Simple tools for storing checking bank statements.

There are a gazillion money management tools 
available, but they all seem to do far too much. 
Doshlogger is simple and easy. 

Bank statements are imported into doshlogger 
from csv format files. All transactions can 
then be viewed and checked off as valid.

This enables you to go through your receipts 
and online transactions and identify anything spurious or missing.
