Simple tools for storing checking bank statements.

There are a gazillion money management tools 
available, but they all seem to do far too much. 
pydosh is simple and easy. 

Bank statements are imported into pydosh 
from csv format files, and stored in a Postgesql database. 
All transactions can then be viewed and checked off as valid.

This enables you to go through your receipts 
and online transactions and identify anything spurious or missing.
