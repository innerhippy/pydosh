<h2><a name="Options_Dialog"></a>Options Dialog</h2>
There are two tabs that configure <a href="#Bank_Codes">Bank
Codes</a> and <a href="#Account_Types">Account Types</a>.<br>
<h3><a name="Bank_Codes"></a>Bank Codes</h3>
<p>Some statements (eg Natwest) contain a banking code that
defines the type of transaction in the statement. If this is available
then it will be displayed in the main window to indicate the type of
transaction. You can also then filter the records on account type - eg
Direct Debits have a code 'D/D'. It doesn matter if your statements do
not have this field.</p>
To change a bank code, double click in the relevant fields and press
enter.<br>
To add a new bank code, press the&nbsp;<img source=":icons/add.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="">
button and add the details.<br>
You can delete a code using the <img source=":icons/delete.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="">
button, as long as it isn't being currently used!<br>
<br>
Press the Save button to confirm the changes.
<h3><a name="Account_Types"></a>Account Types</h3>
This section describes how pydosh interprets the CSV fields from
your bank statement.
<p>Each line in the CSV file from your bank represents a single
transaction, each contains a list of fields separated by commas (hence
the 'C' in 'CSV'...). Each field represents something
about the transaction, the amount, date, description etc. But banks all
have different ways of using the data, so pydosh needs a way of
mapping each field into something it understands.</p>
<p><img style="width: 658px; height: 300px;" alt="" source=":doc/images/accounttypes.png"></p>
The line highlighted above represents the format for some NatWest
statements - the raw&nbsp;CSV record will look like:
<p><small><span style="font-family: monospace;">17/10/2008,C/L,"'BARCLAYS
BNK 17OCT",-100.00,1234.20,"'Mr Me","'100001-12345678",</span></small></p>
<ul>
<li>The date field is index 0</li>
<li>type code 1</li>
<li>description 2.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As this format has negative for outgoing and positive for
incoming, both the credit and debit columns are both 3 (some formats
have separate fields for credit and debit).</li>
<li>balance is 4</li>
<li>currency sign says how monetary amount are repesented,
supply 1 if debit is&nbsp;positive (money going out) or -1 if debit
is negative (usual for credit statements).</li>
<li>format for the date field.</li>
</ul>
If the record has no relevant field for the index, just leave it empty.
