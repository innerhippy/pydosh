<h1>Main Window</h1>
<p>This is the main window for using pydosh.&nbsp;</p>Once you have imported your bank statements, the main window will present all the transactions<br><br><img source=":images/main.png" alt=""> <br><br><p>The
first colum Check indicates if the record has been validated (checked).
The second indicates if the record has been tagged - indicated by&nbsp;a <img alt="" source=":icons/tag_yellow.png"> icon. The other columns are the fields from the statements. Credit (money in) is shown in green, debits as red.</p><p>The
bottom line just gives you information about the database connection,
total money in and out, and number of records shown / number of records
in total.</p><p>There are a few buttons that are hopefully intuitive</p><img source=":icons/date.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt=""> select most recent month only<br><img source=":icons/accept.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt=""> toggles the checked flag for selected records<br><img source=":icons/arrow_refresh.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt=""> reload all data and reset filters<br><img source=":icons/tag_yellow.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt=""> tag selected records. See <a href="#Tags">tags</a> for more info on tags<br><br><h2><a name="Filtering_Records"></a>Filtering Records</h2><p>Filtering can be done in a few ways, according to what you choose in the top three boxes.</p><h3><a name="Date_Filter"></a>Date<br>
</h3><p>The
date filters can specify a date range or click the checkbox to just
show records from the start date field, eg just show Jan 2010. The <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" source=":icons/date.png"> button will just select the most recent month.<br></p><h3><a name="Type_Filter"></a>Filter Filter</h3><p>The second box has three dropdowns, the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">show</span> dropdown selects to show unchecked records only, checked only or all. The <span style="font-style: italic;">account</span> dropdown will filter records for a particular account. The <span style="font-style: italic;">type</span> dropdown filters on the transaction type from the 4th column.<br></p><h3><a name="Text_Filter"></a>Search<br>
</h3><p>This
is probably the most used filter. Type something into the description
box and only records that contain this word or phrase are displayed.
The filtering will occur for each character entered (case is
insensitive).<br></p><p>The amount field filters on the amount colum -
this is probaby the easiest way to fins a transaction, especially when
the filter is set to view only checked records.<br>
</p><p>Basic maths operators can be supplied to the amount field: &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=. <br>
For example, to search for all transactions over ï¿½100 (or $100...), enter <span style="font-weight: bold;">"&gt;100"</span><br>
</p>
<p>The <a href="#Tags">Tag</a> field are discussed in the next section.</p>
<h2><a name="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><p>Somtimes
it is useful to assign arbritrary labels or tags to transactions. For
example if you want to tag a bunch of records that are all to do with
utililty bills, then you assign a tag called utility by selecting the
relevant record (or records) and pressing the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" source=":icons/tag_yellow.png">&nbsp;button. This example uses the NPOWER GAS record.</p><p>This will present a window that initially will have no tags. Press the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" source=":icons/add.png"> button and enter "utility" in the prompt window. This will create a new tag. Now assign this tag by clicking&nbsp;the checkbox,</p><img alt="" source=":doc/images/tagadd.png"><br><br>Press Save, and then you'll see that&nbsp;a tag has appeared next to the NPOWER GAS record.<br><br><img style="width: 623px; height: 68px;" alt="" source=":doc/images/tag_zoom1.png"><br><br>To
use the tags in a filter, just enter the tag you wish to find in the
tag box. The box will auto-complete when you write to try and find your
tags correctly. <br><br>Does this sound difficult? It shouldn't - it's really easy, honest.<br><br></body></html>
