<h1>Doshlogger</h1>
<p> Simple bank account checker to match receipts against
statements. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Every month I&nbsp;diligently go through all my collected
receipts and reference them against my bank statements. It's a pain in
the proverbials trying to match each transaction&nbsp;against the
scraps of paper I collect.</p>
<p>And then Natwest made the statements available for download,
in numerous formats, including CSV. The format of this is a complete
mess, but eventually it made sufficient sense for me to build a pretty
gui tools to import the statements and track everything in a database.<br>
</p>
<p>And hence was born doshlogger.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that each receipt or direct debit can be
easily found and validated against the bank statement - and flagged as <span style="font-style: italic;">checked</span>.
Eventally, you want to concentrate on the transactions for which you
have no record. Are these valid transactions? Has someone beenm dipping
into your account? Has a shop put your credit card through twice? Have
you been over charged? Has a direct debit suddenly taken a hike?</p><p>Basically, by sifting out valid transations, you can focus on the rest.</p><p>doshlogger will import
bank statements into a database which can be MySql, Postgres or sqlite.
The type of statements is can understand is limited to the formats I
have encountered - NatWest, Cater Allen, Credit Agricole &amp; Paypal You can
easily add new accounts that match your own bank statements.</p><p>Once
imported, the transactions are presented to you and once you are happy
that a transaction is ok, just&nbsp;mark it as valid - &nbsp;or as <span style="font-style: italic;">checked</span>.</p><p>There
are numerous filter options that will, for example, only show
transactions from a certain bank, a date range, a format type, an
amount - which can enable you to quickly identify a certain transaction.</p><p>The following sections detail how doshlogger works</p><ul><li><a href="login.html">Login and setting up a new database</a></li><li><a href="main.html">The main window</a></li><li><a href="import.html">Importing statements</a></li><li><a href="options.html">Configuration settings and options</a></li></ul>
